        question: "How do sewage tanks work?",
        answer:
          "A sewage tank, also known as a septic tank, collects wastewater from homes or buildings. It separates solids (which settle at the bottom) and oils/grease (which float to the top), allowing the middle liquid layer to flow into a drain field for further filtration. Bacteria inside the tank help break down organic waste.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why is sewage tank cleaning important?",
        answer:
          "Sewage tank cleaning is crucial for maintaining proper sanitation and health. Regular cleaning prevents blockages and overflow, ensuring smooth waste disposal. It helps reduce the risk of spreading harmful pathogens, which can cause diseases. Proper cleaning also controls unpleasant odors, improving the overall air quality in the area. Moreover, it extends the lifespan of the tank by removing sludge and buildup, preventing damage. Ultimately, timely cleaning promotes a cleaner environment and supports efficient waste management..",
      },
      {
        question: "When should I clean my sewage tank?",
        answer:
          "You should clean your sewage tank every 1 to 3 years, depending on factors like tank size, household usage, and the number of people in your household. If you notice signs like slow drainage, foul odors, gurgling sounds, or wastewater backup, it's a sign that your tank may need cleaning sooner. Regular inspections can help determine the best time for maintenance and prevent costly repairs or health hazards.",
